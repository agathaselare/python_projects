# Encryption

This simple code encrypts using the Caesar method but with a twist. A keyword is inserted and used as the number that switches the letters in your message. 

It also decodes so that whoever you re contacting can decrypt it asa long as they know the keyword and use my code.


## Example:
Keyword: hello
         
Original message: magni topic

Encryption: ufszx btbur

hello (+8,+5,+12,+12,+15)

magni topic (13,1,7,14,9__20,15,16,9,3)

ufszx btbur (21,6,19,26,24__2[28-26],20,2,21,18)

## FYI
I am working on adding the rest of the characters but at the moment please only make use of low caps and spaces or it won't function properly.
